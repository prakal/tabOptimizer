# tabOptimizer
No tab hoarding Chrome extension!

This will prevent you from acquiring too many tabs. Current default is 3, *tabs automatically close after 20 seconds*, and links are preserved in the popup window. Feel free to fork and make the code more efficient/modular. 

**Warning: This was hacked together pretty quickly, so there might be anti-patterns.**
